# Core Management Commands

This directory contains Django management commands for the Fyndora application's core functionality.

## üìã Available Commands

### 1. `seed_data` - Database Seeding Command

Populates your database with realistic test data for development, testing, and demonstration purposes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Seed with default settings (keeps existing data)
# Default: 3 orgs, 6 workspaces, 9 teams, 30 users, 60 entries
uv run manage.py seed_data #

# Clear existing data and seed fresh
# Default: 3 orgs, 6 workspaces, 9 teams, 30 users, 60 entries
uv run manage.py seed_data --clear-existing

# Customize data amounts
# too much data will cause the command to take a long time to run
uv run manage.py seed_data --organizations 5 --workspaces-per-org 10 --teams-per-org 15 --users-per-org 20 --entries-per-workspace 30
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--organizations` | int | 3 | Number of organizations to create |
| `--workspaces-per-org` | int | 2 | Workspaces per organization |
| `--teams-per-org` | int | 3 | Teams per organization |
| `--users-per-org` | int | 10 | Users per organization |
| `--entries-per-workspace` | int | 10 | Entries per workspace |
| `--clear-existing` | flag | False | Clear all existing data before seeding |

## üìä Default Data Counts

When using default settings, the command creates:

| Data Type | Count | Calculation |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Organizations** | 3 | Default value |
| **Workspaces** | 6 | 3 orgs √ó 2 per org |
| **Teams** | 9 | 3 orgs √ó 3 per org |
| **Users** | 30 | 3 orgs √ó 10 per org |
| **Entries** | 60 | 6 workspaces √ó 10 per workspace |
| **Workspace Teams** | 6-18 | Random: 1-3 teams per workspace |
| **Currencies** | 8 | Hardcoded currency list |
| **Exchange Rates** | 51 | (3 orgs √ó 3 currencies √ó 3 dates) + (6 workspaces √ó 2 currencies √ó 2 dates) |

## üîí Safety Features

### Confirmation Required
When using `--clear-existing`, the command requires explicit confirmation:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This will DELETE ALL existing data from the database!
This action cannot be undone. Are you sure you want to continue?
Type 'yes' to confirm: yes
```

**Only typing "yes" will proceed with data deletion.**

### Signal Handling
- Temporarily disables Django signals during database clearing
- Prevents signal-related errors during bulk deletion
- Automatically reconnects signals after completion

## üìä Data Structure Created

### Organizations
- **Naming**: NGO-themed names (e.g., "Azure Foundation", "Crimson Initiative")
- **Uniqueness**: Automatic conflict resolution for duplicate names
- **Users**: 10 users per organization by default
- **Roles**: Organization owner with full permissions

### Workspaces
- **Naming**: Project-based names (e.g., "Azure Education Program")
- **Dates**: Realistic start/end dates (30-180 days ago to 90-365 days future)
- **Roles**: Workspace admin and operations reviewer
- **Rates**: Random remittance rates (80-95%)

### Teams
- **Naming**: Functional team names (e.g., "Azure Program Management")
- **Roles**: Team coordinator assigned
- **Members**: Multiple team members with proper permissions
- **Types**: 30+ different team types (Health Services, Education Support, etc.)

### Users
- **Creation**: Realistic usernames and email addresses using Faker
- **Passwords**: All users get "password123" for easy testing
- **Status**: All users are set to ACTIVE status
- **Roles**: Proper role separation (owner, admin, reviewer, coordinator, member)

### Entries
- **Types**: Income, Disbursement, Remittance
- **Amounts**: Realistic financial amounts based on entry type
- **Currencies**: Multiple currency support with exchange rates
- **Descriptions**: NGO-themed activity descriptions
- **Dates**: Occur within workspace date ranges

### Exchange Rates
- **Organization**: 3 currencies √ó 3 dates per organization
- **Workspace**: 2 currencies √ó 2 dates per workspace
- **Rates**: Random rates (80-120% of base)
- **Approval**: Some workspace rates require approval

### Workspace Teams
- **Assignment**: Random assignment of 1-3 teams per workspace
- **Variability**: Not every workspace gets all teams (more realistic)
- **Custom Rates**: Sometimes custom remittance rates are applied

## üéØ Use Cases

### Development Environment
```bash
# Fresh start for development
uv run manage.py seed_data --clear-existing

# Add more test data
uv run manage.py seed_data --organizations 2
```

### Testing
```bash
# Minimal data for unit tests
uv run manage.py seed_data --organizations 1 --users-per-org 5

# Comprehensive data for integration tests
uv run manage.py seed_data --organizations 3 --entries-per-workspace 50
```

### Demo/Staging
```bash
# Rich dataset for demonstrations
uv run manage.py seed_data --organizations 5 --users-per-org 20 --entries-per-workspace 100
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Production Environment
- **NEVER** use `--clear-existing` in production
- The command is designed for development/testing only
- Always backup your database before running in staging

### Data Relationships
- Organizations ‚Üí Workspaces ‚Üí Teams ‚Üí Entries
- Users are assigned to organizations, then to specific roles
- Exchange rates are created for both organizations and workspaces
- All foreign key relationships are properly maintained

### Performance Considerations
- Large datasets may take several minutes to create
- Consider running during off-peak hours
- Monitor database performance during execution

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Errors
```bash
# Ensure you have database write access
# Check Django user permissions
```

#### Signal Errors
- The command automatically handles signal disconnection
- If you encounter signal errors, the command will show detailed error messages

#### Duplicate Names
- Names are automatically made unique
- If conflicts occur, numbers are appended (e.g., "Foundation 1", "Foundation 2")

### Error Recovery
- If the command fails, check the error messages
- The database will be in a consistent state
- You can safely re-run the command

## üìñ Examples

### Complete Development Setup
```bash
# Clear everything and start fresh
uv run manage.py seed_data --clear-existing \
  --organizations 3 \
  --workspaces-per-org 2 \
  --teams-per-org 3 \
  --users-per-org 10 \
  --entries-per-workspace 20
```

### Add More Test Data
```bash
# Keep existing data, add more organizations
uv run manage.py seed_data --organizations 2
```

### Minimal Test Data
```bash
# Small dataset for quick testing
uv run manage.py seed_data \
  --organizations 1 \
  --workspaces-per-org 1 \
  --teams-per-org 2 \
  --users-per-org 5 \
  --entries-per-workspace 5
```
